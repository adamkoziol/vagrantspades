See the spades pipeline README available at https://github.com/adamkoziol/SPAdesPipeline/blob/master/README.md
for details.

To get the vagrant spades pipeline running

Create a new folder - name it whatever you wish, but please don't include any spaces in any of the folders (don't put it in C:/Program Files/Folder Name). It might still work, but I don't know for sure.

Copy the DockerHostVagrantfile and Vagrantfile into this folder

Create a subfolder called 'data' in this subfolder, copy the folder (referred to as datafolder below) containing the fastq files, as well as the necessary files generated by the MiSeq
SampleSheet.csv
RunInfo.xml
GenerateFASTQRunStatistics.xml

From the command prompt,
change directory to the newly created and populated folder

type:

vagrant up

Wait. The first time this command is performed, the pipeline environment, as well as an Ubuntu image must be downloaded. They're big (~2Gb, and ~500Mb, respectively)

Once vagrant has downloaded the required images and spun up the container, then type:

vagrant ssh

This will connect you to the pipeline environment

To run a datafolder through the pipeline:

type

SPAdesPipeline.py -p /mnt/zvolume1/WGS_Spades/datafolder
